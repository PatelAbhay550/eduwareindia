## Value of Votes in Presidential Elections
- Value of the Vote of MLA = Total Population of state / (Total number of elected MLAs * 1000)
- Value of the Vote of an MP = all MLAs of all states / Total number of elected MPs

The value of an MLA's vote in India's Presidential elections varies by state, and is determined by dividing the state's total population (based on the 1971 census) by the number of elected members in its Legislative Assembly, and then dividing that number by 1000. The value of an MP's vote is calculated by taking the total value of all MLAs' votes across states and dividing it by the total number of elected MPs in Parliament.

- Uttar Pradesh: Has the highest vote value for each MLA at 208.
- Other States: The value ranges from 7 for Sikkim to 151 for West Bengal.
- Delhi and Puducherry: These Union Territories also have their respective MLA vote values, which are 58 and 16 respectively.
