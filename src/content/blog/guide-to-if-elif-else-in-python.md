In programming, we often need our code to perform different actions based on different conditions. This is known as conditional logic, and it's a fundamental concept in Python. The tools for this are the **if**, **elif**, and **else** statements.

This guide will explain how to use them to control the flow of your programs.

## The `if` Statement: The Basic Condition

The **`if`** statement is the most basic conditional statement. It checks if a condition is true. If the condition is true, a specific block of code is executed. If the condition is false, the code block is ignored.

Think of it as a simple question: "Is this condition met? If yes, then perform this action."

Here is a basic example:

```python
is_raining = True

if is_raining:
    print("Remember to take an umbrella.")
```

In this code, the variable `is_raining` is `True`. The `if` statement checks this, and since the condition is true, it runs the `print()` function. If `is_raining` were `False`, the program would simply skip the `print()` statement.
