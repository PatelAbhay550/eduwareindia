## Major Gharanas of Indian Classical Music
Indian classical music has a rich tradition with various gharanas (schools) that have contributed to its evolution. These gharanas are characterized by their unique styles, techniques, and contributions to the art form. Each gharana has its own set of rules, compositions, and notable exponents who have carried forward the legacy.
The term "gharana" is derived from the Hindi word "ghar," meaning "home," and it signifies a lineage or school of music that has been passed down through generations. Gharanas often focus on specific aspects of music, such as vocal techniques, instrumental styles, or particular ragas (melodic frameworks).
The gharanas are not just limited to vocal music but also encompass instrumental music, dance forms like Kathak, and even fusion genres. They play a crucial role in preserving the rich heritage of Indian classical music while also allowing for innovation and adaptation to contemporary styles.
The following are some of the major gharanas in Indian classical music, along with their founders and notable exponents. Each gharana has its own unique characteristics, techniques, and contributions to the art form, making them integral to the rich tapestry of Indian classical music.
