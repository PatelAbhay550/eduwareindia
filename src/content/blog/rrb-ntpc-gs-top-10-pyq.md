### 1. Which of the following is a unit of acceleration?  
**Options:**  
- A) m/sÂ²  
- B) ft/s  
- C) m/s  
- D) mÂ²/s  

**Answer:** A) **m/sÂ²**  
**Explanation:** Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity per second, so its unit is meters per second squared.

### 2. The electric bulb's filament is made of which material?  
**Options:**  
- A) Copper  
- B) Platinum  
- C) Tungsten  
- D) None  

**Answer:** C) **Tungsten**  
**Explanation:** Tungsten is used because it has a high melting point and emits bright light when heated.

### 3. When light ray passes from denser to rarer medium, what happens?  
**Options:**  
- A) It speeds up and bends away from normal  
- B) It slows and bends towards normal
- C) It speeds up and bends towards normal
- D) None of these 
...  

**Answer:** A) **It speeds up and bends away from normal**  
**Explanation:** This is due to Snell's law, which states that light bends away from the normal when moving from a denser to a rarer medium.

### 4. The sum of change in kinetic and potential energy is always:  
**Options:**  
- A) Zero  
- B) Positive  
- C) Negative  
- D) None  

**Answer:** A) **Zero**  
**Explanation:** According to the workâ€“energy theorem, for conservative systems, the total mechanical energy remains constant.

### 5. Pressure inside a soap bubble is:  
**Options:**  
- A) More than atmospheric  
- B) Less  
- C) Equal  
- D) Half  

**Answer:** A) **More than atmospheric**  
**Explanation:** The curved surface creates extra pressure inside than outside.

### 6. Which law governs the heating effect of electric current?  
**Options:**  
- A) Jouleâ€™s Law  
- B) Ohmâ€™s Law  
- C) Faradayâ€™s Law  
- D) Newtonâ€™s Law  

**Answer:** A) **Jouleâ€™s Law**  
**Explanation:** This law states heat produced is proportional to current squared times resistance.

### 7. Unit of pressure is Pascal. Which is *not* measured in Pascals?  
**Options:**  
- A) Moment of inertia  
- B) Pressure  
- C) Stress  
- D) Youngâ€™s modulus  

**Answer:** A) **Moment of inertia**  
**Explanation:** It's measured in kgÂ·mÂ², while pressure, stress, and modulus use Pascal.

### 8. In case of negative work, the angle between force and displacement is:  
**Options:**  
- A) 0Â°  
- B) 45Â°  
- C) 90Â°  
- D) 180Â°  

**Answer:** D) **180Â°**  
**Explanation:** Negative work means force opposes displacement, which means angle is 180Â°.

### 9. Electric bulb glowsâ€”what happens to energy?  
**Options:**  
- A) Fully to light  
- B) Partly light, partly heat  
- C) Light to electrical  
- D) Electrical to magnetic  

**Answer:** B) **Partly light, partly heat**  
**Explanation:** Most input electrical energy in a bulb becomes heat; only some becomes light.

### 10. Which of these is a navigation satellite?  
**Options:**  
- A) GSLV  
- B) PSLV  
- C) IRNSS  
- D) SLV-3  

**Answer:** C) **IRNSS**  
**Explanation:** The Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System is rightfully a navigation satellite.
