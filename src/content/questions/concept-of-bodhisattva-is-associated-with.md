## Explanation
The concept of Bodhisattva is primarily associated with Mahayana Buddhism. In this tradition, a Bodhisattva is an enlightened being who has made a vow to attain Buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings. This involves not only seeking personal enlightenment but also helping others achieve liberation from suffering.  The Bodhisattva ideal emphasizes compassion, altruism, and the interconnectedness of all life. Mahayana Buddhism teaches that anyone can aspire to become a Bodhisattva and that this path is essential for the spiritual development of individuals and the collective well-being of society.
