## Answer
Andhra Pradesh was the first state created on a linguistic basis in India in 1953. It was created following the demand for a separate state for Telugu-speaking people by Potti Sriramulu, who undertook a fast unto death in 1952. He advocated for the creation of a separate state for Telugu speakers, which ultimately led to the formation of Andhra State in 1953
