## Explanation
The term "Ecosystem" was first coined by the British ecologist Arthur Tansley in 1935. He introduced this concept to describe the complex interactions between living organisms and their physical environment.

His work laid the foundation for understanding ecosystems as dynamic systems where biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) components interact.
